### Matt Roden: Aspiring Developer 💻, Student 📚, Noise Maker and Recorder 🎧, Dog-Dad 🐶

An inspired, problem solver with a tremendous thirst for learning and delivering quality solutions. I am a Front End Software Developer specializing in JavaScript, React, HTML5, Sass/SCSS, OOP, and Test Driven Development. My prior experiences as a Field Service Technician and an Audio Engineer have allowed me to lead and see through long winded and large scale projects from start to finish, as well as successfully servicing and managing dozens of smaller projects. I am interested in a future career in music technology, and building tools that are delightful to use that empower people to share their voice and broadcast their talents to the world.

I aim to bring a sense of empathy and inclusion to every project I work on.
