### Matt Roden: Aspiring Developer 💻, Student 📚, Noise Maker and Recorder 🎧, Dog-Dad 🐶

As a Front End Software Development Student at the Turing School of Software & Design, I am currently sharpening my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through both indpendent and collaborative projects. 

I aim to bring a sense of empathy and inclusion to every project I work on.

I am interested in learning more about designing and building music and sound based tools and applications as well as making these types of tools accessible to all!
